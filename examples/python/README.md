# Kompute Python Example

This folder contains the accompanying code for the article "High Performance Python for GPU Accelerated Machine Learning in Cross-Vendor GPUs".

The easiest way to try this example is by using the [Google Binder Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15uQ7qMZuOyk8JcXF-3SB2R5yNFW21I4P), which will allow you to use a GPU for free.

Alternatively if you want to test the example yourself you can follow the following links:

1. Install the Kompute Python Package
2. Run the Array Multiplication Code
3. Run the Logistic Regression Code
